#### Database Storage for Bessie Box
One of the group members in this project worked for [Bessie Box](https://bessiebox.com/), a meat delivery company. They needed a database storage system, and we got a project out of it.
We converted customer information from text files to a database hosted on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) while automating a lot of customer processes. The database itself was implemented in [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), and the app that connected to it used [Psycopg](https://www.psycopg.org/).
